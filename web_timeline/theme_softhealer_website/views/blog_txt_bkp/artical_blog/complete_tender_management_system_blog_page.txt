                                        A tender is a formal request for suppliers or contractors to
                                        bid on specific goods or services. Organizations issue
                                        tenders to create a clear and fair process for buying goods
                                        and services. This helps them find the best value for their
                                        money.

                                        The tender process begins with the organization identifying

                                        document is published to attract possible suppliers or
