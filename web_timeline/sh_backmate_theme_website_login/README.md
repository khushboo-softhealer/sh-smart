About
============
Currently, if you have purchased our backmate theme Backmate Backend Theme Advance and you also have a website module (website or frontend) installed then login logout gets conflict so that's the reason we have made this separate app to get compatibility with Backmate Backend Theme Advance with frontend.

Here in this theme, we provide 4 different well-crafted login styles for desktop and mobile views. You can use these styles on the website. Also, you can set the display company icon/logo on the login screen.

Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
5) search module name and hit install button.
