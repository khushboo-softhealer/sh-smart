You can restrict the quick create any model from the whole odoo. One of the attractive features of Odoo is the ability to create products from sale order lines, invoice lines, and other places. However, sometimes users can create incorrect products or customers accidentally. With the help of this module, you can restrict these types of actions for particular users. Restricting access to product and customer creation can help prevent mistakes and maintain data integrity.
