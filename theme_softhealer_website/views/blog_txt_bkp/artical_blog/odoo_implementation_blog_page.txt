                                        Odoo offers two main versions: Odoo Community (free and
                                        open-source) and Odoo Enterprise (paid with additional
                                        features). The choice between them depends on your budget,
                                        feature requirements, and the need for support.

                                        and streamline operations to make the most out of Odoo’s
                                        capabilities. Odoo offers several workflow tools to automate

                                        One of the biggest challenges during Odoo implementation is
                                        migrating data from legacy systems. A strong data migration
                                        plan ensures that important information moves safely. This
                                        includes customer data, financial records, and inventory
                                        details. The goal is to transfer everything without loss or

                                        workflow.
