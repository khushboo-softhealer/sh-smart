                                        The subscription-based business model is changing many
                                        industries. This includes software as a service, e-commerce,
                                        and entertainment. As businesses grow, it gets harder to
                                        manage recurring payments, customer relationships, and
                                        analytics. ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems

                                        management.
