About
============
Do you want to cancel Payslip of an employee even if it's done? This module helps to cancel payslip which is already in the done state. This module will cancel the journal entry. here we added the "Refunded Payslip" field it shows detail if payslip is refunded.

Here we provide 2 options.
Option 1: If your journal allows canceling entries than you can cancel an entry if it is done.
Option 2: If your journal does not allow canceling entries than it creates a reversal journal entry.
