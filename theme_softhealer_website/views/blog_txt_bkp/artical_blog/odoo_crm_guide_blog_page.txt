                                        Before implementing Odoo CRM, it's essential to analyze your
                                        business needs and define your sales processes.
                                        Understanding your requirements will help you customize Odoo
                                        CRM to align with your goals.

                                        After identifying your needs, the next step is to set up and
                                        configure Odoo CRM. This involves setting up user roles,
                                        importing customer data, and configuring the sales pipeline
                                        to match your business processes.
