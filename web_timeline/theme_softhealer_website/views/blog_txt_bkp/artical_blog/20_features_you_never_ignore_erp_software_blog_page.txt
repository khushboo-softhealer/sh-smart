                                        Start by creating a detailed feature checklist that covers must-have functionalities like inventory management, financial management, and integration capabilities. This checklist will help you compare different features of ERP systems side-by-side.

                                        Next, align these features with your specific business goals and industry requirements. For example, a manufacturing company will need strong production planning features, while a retail business might focus more on sales and inventory management. Understanding this helps narrow down the ERP system capabilities that matter most.

                                        Another common mistake is poor user adoption. If the ERP system lacks user-friendly features of ERP systems, employees might resist using it, which lowers productivity and accuracy.

                                        Integration problems can also happen if the ERP system doesn’t connect well with other business tools. Without strong ERP system capabilities for integration, data silos form, making business processes slow and complicated.
