About
============
The Sale Quotation Template Module will help users not to create sale orders repeatedly for the frequently sold product. In the sale order select the products, quantity, price, discount (if any), and taxes and click on the Create quotation template button all the details will be stored as a reusable template. It will maintain consistency in prices, discounts, and products from multiple orders. It will reduce manual data entry for frequently sold products.
