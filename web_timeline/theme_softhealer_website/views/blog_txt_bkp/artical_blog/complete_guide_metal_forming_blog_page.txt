                                        Metal forming is a fundamental part of industrial manufacturing, where raw metal is transformed into useful parts and components. It involves applying mechanical forces—such as compression, tension, or shear—to reshape metal without removing material. These metal-forming processes are vital in industries ranging from automotive to aerospace.

                                        Understanding casting is the first step in the broader discussion of casting vs forging. As we continue comparing casting and forging, you’ll see how casting excels in design flexibility but may differ in mechanical strength—one of the critical differences between casting and forging.

                                        Forging is a powerful metal forming process that shapes metal using compressive force—usually with a hammer, press, or die—while the metal is in a solid or semi-solid state.

                                        Unlike casting, which deals with molten metal, forging works with heated but non-molten material, giving the final product superior mechanical strength and grain structure.

                                        Forging has been used for centuries in metalworking, especially for parts that require high durability and stress resistance.

                                                    Metal is melted until it becomes a liquid. It’s then poured into a mold made of sand, ceramic, or metal. After cooling and solidifying, the cast part is removed. This process is ideal for creating complex shapes and internal cavities.

                                                    Metal is heated to a malleable temperature but never melted. Compressive force is then applied via hammering, pressing, or rolling to form the shape. It involves solid-state deformation, which strengthens the metal.

                                        Choosing between casting vs forging depends on your project needs—whether it's strength, complexity, or cost. The key difference between casting and forging lies in how the metal is formed: casting involves melting and molding, while forging uses solid-state pressure to shape the metal.
