                                        By automating many routine tasks like ticketing, payment processing, and vehicle tracking, a parking automation system cuts down on the need for manual labor. This means fewer staff members are required to manage parking, which reduces operating expenses. Automated alerts and notifications also help maintain equipment better and avoid downtime, saving time and money.
