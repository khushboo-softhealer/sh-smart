                                        may need custom fields, reports, or workflows. Before
                                        customizing, ensure your core processes match the standard
                                        Odoo features. Too much customization can make future

                                        Data migration is often one of the most challenging aspects
                                        of ERP implementation. Before migrating data, ensure that it
                                        is clean and relevant. This includes removing duplicate
                                        records, verifying data accuracy, and standardizing formats.

                                        exercise to ensure consistency between old and new systems.
                                        Many businesses opt for a phased data migration, allowing
                                        for better accuracy and minimal disruption.

                                        Before launching the system company-wide, conduct thorough
