                                        A positive onboarding experience sets the tone for the entire tenancy. A smooth and professional tenant onboarding process includes online applications, e-signing, digital welcome kits, and move-in checklists. Providing clear communication and quick support during this phase ensures tenants feel valued and informed. The better the onboarding, the more likely tenants are to stay long-term and recommend your property to others.
