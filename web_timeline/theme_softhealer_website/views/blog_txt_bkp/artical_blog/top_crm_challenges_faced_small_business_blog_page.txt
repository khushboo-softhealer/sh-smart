                                        A common CRM challenge for small businesses is not getting the right support and training. Without clear guidance, teams can feel lost and unsure about how to use key CRM features. This often leads to CRM adoption issues and slows down progress.

                                        Pick a CRM that your team can start using without weeks of training. A clean layout, helpful tips, and fast setup make a big difference, especially when CRM adoption issues are common.

                                        Your CRM should connect easily with tools you already use — like email, invoices, or online stores. Strong integration helps avoid CRM issues faced by small businesses, like scattered data and manual work.
