                                    Odoo is a suite of business solutions, offering two types of
                                    editions: Enterprise and Community.
                                    The Enterprise edition is licensed and provides additional
                                    features compared to the Community
                                    version. The Community version, on the other hand, is fully
                                    open-source but comes with limited
                                    features. However, both versions share a common aspect: they are
                                    customizable according to
                                    your requirements.
