About
============
Sometimes employees accidentally forget to do check-in/check-out so this module helps employees to send attendance modification requests to the manager. The manager gets a notification about the attendance modification request sent by the employee and when they approve or reject requests, an employee gets a notification about it.

Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
5) search module name and hit install button.
