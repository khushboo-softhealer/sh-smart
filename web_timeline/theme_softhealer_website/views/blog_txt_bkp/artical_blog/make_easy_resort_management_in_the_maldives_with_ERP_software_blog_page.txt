                                    An ERP system fosters better communication and coordination between different departments within the resort.

                                    ERP systems automate the booking process. When guests make a reservation, the system updates room availability in real-time, preventing overbooking. Automated confirmations, reminders, and special requests make the process smoother for both guests and staff.
