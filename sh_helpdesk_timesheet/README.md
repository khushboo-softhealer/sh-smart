About
============
In this module, you can manage the helpdesk ticket timesheet which shows how much work done and how much time spent on the particular ticket. If you have the same description for all the timesheets then we have added a special feature "default description" that will automatically add default description entry when you end timer.

3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
