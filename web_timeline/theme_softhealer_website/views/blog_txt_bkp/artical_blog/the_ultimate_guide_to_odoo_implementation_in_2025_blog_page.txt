Many businesses, especially those new to ERP systems, encounter common roadblocks during the process. A well-defined ERP implementation roadmap and the support of a reliable Odoo implementation company can help mitigate these issues, but being aware of the challenges is the first step to overcoming them.

                                      One of the most common obstacles in any Odoo implementation is resistance from within the organization. Employees may be hesitant to move away from familiar systems or manual processes. Without proper change management strategies, businesses may face delays in system adoption and decreased productivity.
