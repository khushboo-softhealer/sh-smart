                                        Inventory is the backbone of any product-based business. How you manage inventory can greatly affect your operations.

                                        This is true whether you are handling raw materials in a factory or tracking finished goods in a warehouse. Many businesses, both big and small, face problems with inventory management. These issues can hurt profits, delay deliveries, and frustrate customers.

When it comes to handling inventory management issues, an ERP system brings together all your operations—purchasing, sales, warehouse, finance, and more—into one unified platform.
