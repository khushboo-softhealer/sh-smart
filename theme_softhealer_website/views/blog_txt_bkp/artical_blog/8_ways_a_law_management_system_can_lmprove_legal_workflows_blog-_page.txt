                                    What is a Legal Workflow?
                                    </h2>

                                    A legal workflow is a step-by-step process your law firm follows to complete a legal task, from client intake to case closure. Think of it as a roadmap that outlines how work moves across your team. It covers everything: assigning responsibilities, setting deadlines, managing documents, and ensuring timely follow-ups.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="sh_text">
                                    For example, when a new client signs on, your legal workflow might involve collecting their documents, assigning the case to a lawyer, scheduling meetings, drafting legal notices, and tracking progress. These aren’t just tasks—they’re parts of a system that must work together smoothly.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="sh_text">
                                    Without proper structure, it’s easy to miss deadlines, lose track of files, or create confusion between team members. This is where legal workflow management becomes essential. When your firm uses modern legal workflow software or a complete law office software solution, these processes become streamlined, automated, and easier to manage at scale.
                                    </p>

                                    In short, a legal workflow is how your firm gets work done, and improving it can lead directly to faster results, better client service, and stronger outcomes.
